October First committee mission:
================================

Our goal is to enable artists, not to dictate art ideas.  We want to
present our creative collaborators with a menu of proven components
and to encourage them to incorporate these items into their designs early
in their artistic process.

Additionally, we want the "worker bees" to be able to quickly assemble
the art pieces on playa during the first few days of build week and then
enjoy the party.  Common components, connectors and modular design make
this easier.
